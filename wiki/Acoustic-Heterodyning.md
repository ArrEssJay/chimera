## Overview

**Acoustic heterodyning** (or **parametric acoustic arrays**) is a nonlinear phenomenon where two ultrasound beams at frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$ mix in a medium to produce sound at the **difference frequency** $f_\Delta = |f_1 - f_2|$. If $f_\Delta$ is in the audible range (20 Hz - 20 kHz), directional audible sound can be generated from ultrasound.

**Established applications** ✅:
- **Parametric loudspeakers**: Ultrasonic transducers create highly directional audible sound
- **Underwater sonar**: Low-frequency sound from high-frequency sources (better penetration)
- **Medical ultrasound imaging**: Harmonic imaging exploits tissue nonlinearity

**Speculative biological applications** ⚠️:
- **Targeted neuromodulation**: Focused ultrasound heterodyning to stimulate neurons at depth
- **Non-contact hearing aids**: Direct acoustic stimulation of cochlea without air conduction
