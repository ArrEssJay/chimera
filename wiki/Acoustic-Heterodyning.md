## Overview

**Acoustic heterodyning** (parametric acoustic arrays) exploits **nonlinear acoustics**: two ultrasound beams at $f_1$, $f_2$ mix to produce audible difference frequency $f_\Delta = |f_1 - f_2|$.

**Established ✅**: Parametric loudspeakers, underwater sonar, medical harmonic imaging  
**Speculative ⚠️**: Neural stimulation via focused ultrasound heterodyning

## 1. Physical Mechanism ✅

**Nonlinear wave equation**:
$$\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2 p = \frac{\beta}{\rho_0 c^2} \frac{\partial^2 (p^2)}{\partial t^2}$$
where $\beta$ is nonlinear parameter (~5 for water, ~3.5-6 for tissue).

**Two-tone input**: $p_1 \cos\omega_1 t + p_2 \cos\omega_2 t$  
**Nonlinear term** $p^2$ contains: $\cos(\omega_1 - \omega_2)t$ → difference frequency

**Amplitude**: $p_\Delta \propto \beta k_1 k_2 A_1 A_2 L$ (proportional to interaction length)

**Efficiency**: ~0.01-1% (ultrasound power → audible power)

---

## 2. Parametric Loudspeakers ✅

**Principle**: Ultrasound beam (e.g., 40 kHz) is highly directional (~5° beamwidth). Audible difference frequency inherits directionality.

**Commercial products**: Audio Spotlight (Holosonics) — targeted sound for museums, retail

**Advantages**: Directional low-frequency sound without large transducers  
**Limitations**: Low efficiency, nonlinear distortion

---

## 3. Medical Harmonic Imaging ✅

**Technique**: Transmit ultrasound at $f_0$, receive at $2f_0$ (second harmonic generated by tissue nonlinearity).

**Clinical use**: Echocardiography, liver imaging (standard practice)  
**Advantage**: Improved resolution and reduced clutter

---

## 4. Biological Tissue Nonlinearity ✅

**Tissue nonlinear parameter**:
- Muscle: $\beta \approx 5.5$  
- Fat: $\beta \approx 10$ (highly nonlinear!)  
- Liver: $\beta \approx 6.5$

**Consequence**: Tissue is as nonlinear as or more than water → heterodyning feasible.

## 5. Neuromodulation Hypothesis ⚠️

**Concept**: Two focused ultrasound beams ($f_1 \approx f_2$) cross in brain → difference frequency $f_\Delta$ stimulates mechanosensitive ion channels.

**Advantages** (theoretical):
- Spatial selectivity (only overlap region affected)  
- Tunable frequency  
- Non-invasive

**Challenges**:
1. **Low efficiency** → high intensity needed (>1 W/cm²) → safety concerns  
2. **Skull distortion** → adaptive focusing required  
3. **Mechanism unclear** → thermal vs. mechanical?

**Experimental status** ⚠️:
- *In vitro*: Some calcium signaling observed (Ye et al., 2018)  
- *In vivo*: Behavioral changes in mice (mechanism debated)  
- *Humans*: No transcranial studies published

---

## 6. Ultrasonic Hearing? ⚠️

**Hypothesis**: Dual ultrasound beams → heterodyning in cochlea → auditory perception

**Evidence**: Mixed  
- Lin & Wang (1978): Reported effect  
- Foster et al. (1982): Could not replicate (attributed to equipment artifacts)

**Consensus**: **No robust evidence** for ultrasonic heterodyning in human hearing (confounded by bone conduction, subharmonics).

## 7. Underwater Sonar ✅

**Parametric sonar**: Transmit high-frequency beams → ocean nonlinearity generates directional low-frequency sound.

**Applications**: Submarine communication, bathymetric mapping, marine mammal deterrence.

---

## 8. Safety

**FDA diagnostic ultrasound limits**: <720 mW/cm² (ISPTA)  
**Parametric arrays**: Typically >1 W/cm² (above diagnostic, below therapeutic ~100 W/cm²)

**Risks**: Heating (thermal index), cavitation (mechanical index)  
**Mitigation**: Lower pressures, avoid gas-filled tissues, monitor with passive cavitation detection

---

## 9. Mathematical Model: Westervelt Equation

**Analytical solution** (planar wave):
$$p_\Delta(x) = \frac{\beta k_1 k_2 A_1 A_2}{4 \rho_0 c^2 \alpha_\Delta} \left(1 - e^{-\alpha_\Delta x}\right)$$
where $\alpha_\Delta$ is absorption at difference frequency.
