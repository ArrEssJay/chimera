# Constellation Diagrams

## 🌟 For Non-Technical Readers

**A constellation diagram is like a visual map showing all the "hand signals" your WiFi/phone can use to send data—each dot is a unique signal position!**

**The analogy - Lighthouse signals**:
- Imagine you're communicating with lighthouse beams
- You can vary: **brightness** (amplitude) and **color** (phase)
- Each unique combination = one symbol (represents some bits)
- Constellation diagram = map showing all possible combinations!

**Real example - QPSK (4 dots)**:
```
     Q
     ↑
  •  |  •   ← 4 positions = 2 bits per symbol
─────┼─────→ I
  •  |  •
```
- Top-right • = "00"
- Top-left • = "01"
- Bottom-left • = "10"
- Bottom-right • = "11"

**Why dots matter**:
- **More dots** = more data per symbol = faster!
  - QPSK: 4 dots (2 bits/symbol)
  - 16-QAM: 16 dots (4 bits/symbol) = 2× faster
  - 256-QAM: 256 dots (8 bits/symbol) = 4× faster!
- **Dots closer together** = harder to distinguish when noisy
  - Your phone uses fewer dots when signal is weak (reliable)
  - Uses more dots when signal is strong (fast!)

**When you see it**:
- **WiFi speed negotiation**: "Constellation: 64-QAM" = using 64-dot map
- **Spectrum analyzer**: Shows received dots scattered around ideal positions (noise!)
- **Signal quality**: Dots tight = good signal, dots spread out = noisy channel

**Fun fact**: Your WiFi constantly monitors how scattered the received dots are and automatically switches between constellations (4/16/64/256/1024-QAM) to optimize speed vs reliability!

A **constellation diagram** is a visual representation of a digital modulation scheme. It shows all possible symbol positions in the I/Q plane.

## Reading a Constellation Diagram

```
      Q (Imaginary)
           ↑
           |
      ┌────┼────┐
      │ •  |  • │  Each dot represents
      │    |    │  a valid symbol position
   ───┼────+────┼───→ I (Real)
      │    |    │
      │ •  |  • │
      └────┼────┘
           |
```

## Key Elements

1. **Ideal Points**: Perfect symbol positions (clean transmission)
2. **Received Cloud**: Actual received symbols scattered due to noise
3. **Decision Boundaries**: Regions that determine which symbol was sent

## TX vs RX Constellations

### TX Constellation (Transmitter)
- Shows ideal symbol positions
- Points are crisp and perfectly positioned
- Represents what was intended to be transmitted

### RX Constellation (Receiver)
- Shows received symbol positions after channel effects
- Points are scattered in clouds around ideal positions
- Scattering indicates noise level and channel quality
- Larger scatter = more noise = harder to decode correctly

## What the Constellation Tells You

| Pattern | Meaning | Quality |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Tight clusters | Low noise, high SNR | Excellent |
| Scattered clouds | High noise, low SNR | Poor |
| Symbol overlap | Very poor signal quality | Critical |
| Pattern offset | Frequency or phase errors | Requires correction |

## Example: QPSK Constellation at Different SNR Levels

### High SNR (-5 dB Channel)
```
  Q
  ↑
• | •     ← Tight clusters
──┼──→ I    Perfect separation
• | •
```

### Medium SNR (-15 dB Channel)
```
  Q
  ↑
◦•◦| ◦•◦   ← Visible scatter
◦◦•◦|◦◦•◦    Still decodable
────┼────→ I
◦•◦| ◦•◦
◦◦•◦|◦◦•◦
```

### Low SNR (-25 dB Channel)
```
  Q
  ↑
 ◦◦◦|◦◦◦    ← Heavy scatter
◦◦•◦◦|◦◦•◦◦   Errors likely
◦◦◦•◦|◦◦•◦◦◦  FEC required
─────┼─────→ I
◦◦◦•◦|◦◦•◦◦◦
◦◦•◦◦|◦◦•◦◦
 ◦◦◦|◦◦◦
```

## Observing Constellations in Chimera

When you run a simulation:

1. **TX Constellation Panel**: See the ideal QPSK symbol positions
2. **RX Constellation Panel**: See how noise scatters the received symbols
3. **Adjust SNR**: Watch how constellation quality changes in real-time

The constellation is the most intuitive way to understand signal quality!
