## üì° For Non-Technical Readers

**Radio waves can travel three different ways‚Äîthink of it like: rolling on the ground, bouncing off the sky, or shooting straight like a laser!**

**1. Ground Wave** (Surface Wave) üåç
- **What**: Radio wave hugs the Earth's surface and bends around the curve
- **Frequency**: Low (AM radio, 500 kHz - 1.5 MHz)
- **Range**: 100-1000+ km depending on frequency
- **Analogy**: Rolling a ball on the ground‚Äîit follows the terrain

**Real example**: 
- **AM radio stations**: Travel hundreds of miles, even over the horizon
- **Why AM works everywhere**: Ground wave bends around hills/buildings
- **Maritime communications**: Ships use ground wave to communicate over the ocean

**2. Sky Wave** (Ionospheric Bounce) ‚òÅÔ∏è
- **What**: Radio wave shoots up, bounces off ionosphere (layer of charged particles 100-400 km up), comes back down
- **Frequency**: Medium (shortwave radio, 3-30 MHz / HF)
- **Range**: Global! Can bounce multiple times
- **Analogy**: Skipping a stone on water‚Äîone throw, many bounces

**Real example**:
- **Shortwave radio**: Broadcast from London, heard in Australia!
- **Amateur (ham) radio**: Talk to people on other continents
- **Why it works at night**: Ionosphere gets stronger after sunset (no sun breaking it apart)

**3. Line-of-Sight** (LOS) üëÄ
- **What**: Radio wave travels straight like light‚Äîif you can't "see" the tower, signal is blocked
- **Frequency**: High (FM radio, TV, cell phones, WiFi, 30 MHz+)
- **Range**: Limited to visible horizon (~5-50 km depending on height)
- **Analogy**: Laser pointer‚Äîmust have clear path

**Real example**:
- **Cell phones**: Need tower in view (mostly)
- **WiFi**: Walls/floors block it
- **Satellite TV**: Dish must point directly at satellite (trees in the way = no signal!)
- **5G mmWave**: Can't even go through your hand!

**Why different modes?**
- **Lower frequency** ‚Üí bends around obstacles, long range, slow data
- **Higher frequency** ‚Üí straight-line only, shorter range, fast data

**Fun fact**: During the Cold War, governments used sky wave propagation to broadcast radio into other countries‚Äîsignals would bounce off the ionosphere and arrive "from above," impossible to block!

## Overview

**Electromagnetic waves propagate via different mechanisms** depending on frequency, distance, and environment. Understanding propagation modes is essential for predicting coverage and designing wireless systems.

**Three primary modes**:
1. **Ground Wave** (Surface wave) - LF/MF/HF, follows Earth's curvature
2. **Sky Wave** (Ionospheric) - HF, bounces off ionosphere, global reach
3. **Line-of-Sight (LOS)** - VHF and above, direct path required

---

## Ground Wave Propagation

### Definition

**Ground wave** = EM wave that travels along Earth's surface, guided by the ground-air interface.

**Mechanism**: 
- Electric field induces currents in ground (conductive surface)
- Ground acts as imperfect dielectric, slows wave slightly
- **Diffraction** allows wave to follow Earth's curvature (beyond horizon)

**Frequency range**: **LF to MF** (30 kHz - 3 MHz), limited use in **HF** (3-30 MHz)

---

### Attenuation Factors

**Ground wave attenuation depends on**:

1. **Frequency**: Higher frequency = more attenuation
2. **Ground conductivity**: Seawater (high œÉ) < freshwater < wet soil < dry soil < ice
3. **Distance**: Exponential decay with range
4. **Polarization**: **Vertical polarization required** (horizontal is rapidly attenuated)

---

#### Ground Conductivity

| Surface Type | Conductivity (S/m) | Relative Permittivity $\epsilon_r$ | Attenuation |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| Seawater | 5 | 80 | **Very low** (best) |
| Freshwater | 0.01 | 80 | Low |
| Wet soil | 0.01-0.001 | 20-30 | Moderate |
| Dry soil | 0.001 | 3-10 | High |
| Urban/concrete | 0.001 | 5 | High |
| Ice/snow | 0.0001 | 3 | Very high |

**Maritime advantage**: Ships can communicate over 1000+ km at LF/MF (AM broadcast)

**Desert disadvantage**: Dry sand severely limits ground wave (100s of meters)

---

### Range vs Frequency

**Empirical range** (over average soil, vertical polarization):

| Frequency | Wavelength | Typical Range | Applications |
|-----------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| 50 kHz (VLF) | 6000 m | 500-1000 km | Navigation (LORAN) |
| 150 kHz (LF) | 2000 m | 300-800 km | Longwave broadcast |
| 500 kHz (MF) | 600 m | 200-500 km | Marine distress (SOS) |
| 1 MHz (AM) | 300 m | 100-300 km | AM radio (nighttime skywave extends this) |
| 3 MHz (HF) | 100 m | 10-50 km | Limited ground wave, skywave dominant |

**Key insight**: **Ground wave range decreases rapidly with frequency**

---

### Path Loss Model

**Norton ground wave equation** (simplified):

$$
L_{\text{ground}} = L_{\text{FS}} + A_{\text{ground}}(f, d, \sigma, \epsilon_r)
$$

Where:
- $L_{\text{FS}}$ = Free-space path loss
- $A_{\text{ground}}$ = Additional ground attenuation (complex function, see ITU-R P.368)

**Approximation** (MF band, average soil):

$$
A_{\text{ground}} \approx 0.1 \times \left(\frac{f}{1\ \text{MHz}}\right)^2 \times \left(\frac{d}{1\ \text{km}}\right) \quad (\text{dB})
$$

**Example**: 1 MHz, 100 km over average soil:

$$
A_{\text{ground}} \approx 0.1 \times 1^2 \times 100 = 10\ \text{dB additional loss}
$$

---

### Applications

#### AM Radio (540-1600 kHz)

**Daytime**: Ground wave only
- Local coverage: 50-150 km
- Limited by ground conductivity

**Nighttime**: Skywave + ground wave
- Extended coverage: 500-2000+ km (skywave reflection)
- Interference common (multiple stations bounce off ionosphere)

---

#### Maritime Communications (LF/MF)

**VLF (20-100 kHz)**: Submarine comms
- Penetrates seawater (10-20 m depth)
- Global coverage (ground wave over ocean)
- Very low data rate (< 100 bps)

**MF (300-3000 kHz)**: Ship-to-shore
- 200-500 km range over seawater
- Distress frequency: 500 kHz (historical SOS)

---

#### Aviation NDB (Non-Directional Beacons)

**Frequency**: 190-535 kHz
**Range**: 50-100 km (ground wave)
**Use**: Aircraft homing (ADF receivers)

---

## Sky Wave (Ionospheric Propagation)

### Definition

**Sky wave** = EM wave refracted by ionosphere, returning to Earth at distant location.

**Mechanism**:
1. HF wave travels upward at angle
2. Ionosphere (charged plasma layer, 60-400 km altitude) acts as refractive medium
3. Wave bends back toward Earth (if frequency/angle correct)
4. Can bounce multiple times (multi-hop)

**Frequency range**: **HF (3-30 MHz)** primarily, some **MF at night**

---

### Ionospheric Layers

**Ionosphere = ionized by solar UV/X-rays**

| Layer | Altitude | Ionization | Daytime Behavior | Nighttime Behavior |
|-------|----------|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **D** | 60-90 km | Low | **Absorbs HF** (attenuates MF/HF) | **Disappears** (recombination fast) |
| **E** | 90-150 km | Moderate | Reflects some HF (< 10 MHz) | Weakens |
| **F1** | 150-250 km | Moderate | Reflects MF/HF | **Merges with F2** |
| **F2** | 250-400 km | High | **Primary reflector** for HF | Descends, remains strong |

**Key concept**: **Critical frequency** $f_c$ - maximum frequency reflected at vertical incidence

$$
f_c = 9 \sqrt{N_e}
$$

Where $N_e$ = electron density (electrons/m¬≥)

**Typical values**:
- Daytime F2: $f_c = 10-15$ MHz
- Nighttime F2: $f_c = 5-10$ MHz

---

### Skip Distance & Hop

**Skip distance** = minimum ground range for sky wave return

$$
d_{\text{skip}} = 2h \tan(\theta)
$$

Where:
- $h$ = Ionospheric layer height
- $\theta$ = Elevation angle of departure

**For F2 layer** (h ‚âà 300 km):
- Low angle (5¬∞): Skip ~3500 km (single hop)
- High angle (45¬∞): Skip ~600 km

**Dead zone** = Region between ground wave limit and skip distance (no coverage)

---

### Multi-Hop Propagation

**Wave bounces between ionosphere and ground**:

- **Single hop**: 2000-4000 km
- **Two hops**: 4000-8000 km
- **Multiple hops**: Global coverage possible (with sufficient power)

**Loss per hop**: 5-15 dB (depends on ionospheric conditions, frequency)

---

### Frequency Selection

**MUF (Maximum Usable Frequency)**: Highest frequency that refracts back (not penetrating ionosphere)

$$
\text{MUF} = \frac{f_c}{\cos(\theta)}
$$

**LUF (Lowest Usable Frequency)**: Lowest frequency not absorbed by D-layer

**Optimal Working Frequency (FOT)**: 80-90% of MUF (safety margin)

---

### Diurnal Variations

**Daytime**:
- D-layer absorbs lower HF (< 5 MHz)
- F2 layer reflects higher HF (10-30 MHz)
- **Best bands**: 15 MHz, 20 MHz (long-distance)

**Nighttime**:
- D-layer disappears (no absorption)
- F2 descends, lower MUF
- **Best bands**: 5 MHz, 7 MHz (medium-distance)
- AM broadcast skywave active (500-1600 kHz)

---

### Seasonal & Solar Cycle Effects

**Solar cycle** (11 years):
- **Solar max**: High ionization, higher MUF (30 MHz+ usable)
- **Solar min**: Lower MUF (often < 20 MHz)

**Seasonal**:
- **Summer**: Higher D-layer absorption (daytime)
- **Winter**: Lower absorption, better long-distance (daytime)

**Sporadic E** (Es):
- Unpredictable intense E-layer patches
- Reflects VHF (up to 150 MHz!) for short periods
- Used opportunistically by amateur radio

---

### Applications

#### Shortwave Broadcast

**Frequency**: 3-30 MHz (HF bands)
**Range**: 500-10,000+ km (multi-hop)
**Use**: International broadcasting (BBC World Service, Voice of America)

**Schedule management**: Different frequencies for day/night, seasons

---

#### Amateur Radio (Ham Radio)

**HF bands**: 1.8, 3.5, 7, 10, 14, 18, 21, 24, 28 MHz
**Activity**: Global communication with < 100W (due to skywave)

**80m (3.5 MHz)**: Nighttime, regional (500-2000 km)
**20m (14 MHz)**: Daytime, worldwide (DX)

---

#### Over-the-Horizon (OTH) Radar

**Frequency**: 5-28 MHz
**Range**: 1000-3500 km (beyond line-of-sight)
**Use**: Early warning, detection beyond horizon

**Principle**: Reflect radar signal off ionosphere to detect aircraft/ships at great distance

---

#### Military HF Communications

**Strategic links**: Long-range, no satellite dependence
**Frequency hopping**: Adapt to ionospheric conditions
**Robustness**: Survives nuclear EMP (no infrastructure needed)

---

## Line-of-Sight (LOS) Propagation

### Definition

**Line-of-sight** = Direct path from transmitter to receiver, no obstructions.

**Frequency range**: **VHF and above** (> 30 MHz)

**Why?**: At VHF+, waves no longer refract around Earth's curvature (ionosphere transparent)

---

### Radio Horizon

**Geometric horizon** (flat Earth): Distance where curvature blocks LOS

**Radio horizon** (accounting for refraction):

$$
d_{\text{horizon}} = 3.57(\sqrt{h_t} + \sqrt{h_r}) \quad (\text{km})
$$

Where:
- $h_t$ = Transmitter antenna height (meters)
- $h_r$ = Receiver antenna height (meters)
- **4/3 Earth radius model** accounts for atmospheric refraction

---

#### Examples

**Mobile phone** (base station 30m, phone 1.5m):

$$
d = 3.57(\sqrt{30} + \sqrt{1.5}) = 3.57(5.48 + 1.22) = 24\ \text{km}
$$

**TV broadcast tower** (300m, home antenna 10m):

$$
d = 3.57(\sqrt{300} + \sqrt{10}) = 3.57(17.3 + 3.16) = 73\ \text{km}
$$

**Aircraft at 10,000m** (cruising altitude):

$$
d = 3.57 \sqrt{10000} = 357\ \text{km}
$$

**Satellite (LEO at 550 km)**: Horizon ~2500 km (covers ~5% of Earth)

---

### Fresnel Zone

**For reliable LOS, path must be clear not just geometrically, but also volumetrically**.

**Fresnel zone** = Ellipsoidal region around direct path where reflections can interfere

**First Fresnel zone radius** at midpoint:

$$
r_1 = \sqrt{\frac{\lambda d_1 d_2}{d_1 + d_2}}
$$

Where:
- $\lambda$ = Wavelength
- $d_1, d_2$ = Distances from TX and RX to obstacle

**60% clearance rule**: Keep first Fresnel zone 60% clear for reliable LOS

**Example**: 2 GHz (Œª = 15 cm), 10 km link:

$$
r_1 = \sqrt{\frac{0.15 \times 5000 \times 5000}{10000}} = \sqrt{375} = 19\ \text{m}
$$

**Need**: 60% √ó 19m = **11m clearance** at midpoint

---

### Applications

#### FM Radio (VHF, 88-108 MHz)

**Range**: Line-of-sight limited
- Transmitter tower: 100-300m ‚Üí 40-70 km range
- Terrain shadowing common (mountains block signal)

---

#### TV Broadcast (VHF/UHF)

**VHF**: Channels 2-13 (54-216 MHz) - legacy analog
**UHF**: Channels 14-51 (470-698 MHz) - digital TV (ATSC, DVB-T)

**Range**: 40-100 km (depends on tower height)

---

#### Cellular (800 MHz - 6 GHz)

**Macrocells**: LOS to horizon (~10-30 km)
**Microcells**: Urban, 200m-2km (NLOS due to buildings, but diffraction/scattering help)
**Picocells**: Indoor, 10-100m

---

#### Microwave Links (6-80 GHz)

**Point-to-point backhaul**:
- Tower-to-tower links (10-50 km)
- Requires clear Fresnel zone
- Rain fade significant (see [[Weather-Effects-(Rain-Fade,-Fog-Attenuation)]])

---

#### Satellite Communications

**All satellite links are LOS**:
- GEO (35,786 km): Always LOS if above 10¬∞ elevation
- LEO (400-1200 km): Pass overhead, 5-15 min visibility windows
- MEO (GPS, 20,200 km): 4-8 hours visibility

---

#### 5G mmWave (24-100 GHz)

**Ultra-short range LOS**:
- Range: 100-500m typical
- Building penetration: Poor (requires outdoor-to-outdoor LOS)
- Use: Dense urban, stadiums, fixed wireless access

---

## Comparison: Propagation Modes

| Mode | Frequency | Range | Characteristics | Applications |
|------|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Ground Wave** | LF/MF | 50-500 km | Follows curvature, stable, vertical pol | AM radio, maritime, NDB |
| **Sky Wave** | HF | 500-10,000+ km | Ionospheric reflection, variable | Shortwave, amateur, OTH radar |
| **LOS** | VHF+ | 10-100 km | Direct path, terrain-limited | FM, TV, cellular, microwave |
| **Satellite LOS** | VHF-Ka | Global | Space path, rain fade (>10 GHz) | GPS, satellite TV/internet |
| **Troposcatter** | UHF/SHF | 100-500 km | Beyond-horizon scatter | Military long-haul |

---

## Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) Propagation

**Even at VHF+, signals can reach beyond LOS via**:

1. **Diffraction**: Bending around obstacles (buildings, hills)
2. **Reflection**: Bounce off surfaces (see [[Multipath-Propagation-&-Fading-(Rayleigh,-Rician)|Multipath Propagation & Fading]])
3. **Scattering**: Random scatter from rough surfaces, rain, foliage
4. **Troposcatter**: Forward scatter from tropospheric turbulence (beyond-horizon, 100-500 km)

**Result**: Cellular networks work in urban canyons (NLOS), but with higher path loss and multipath fading.

---

## Ducting & Anomalous Propagation

### Tropospheric Ducting

**Temperature inversion** creates refractive layer that traps VHF/UHF waves:

**Mechanism**: Warm air over cool surface ‚Üí gradient in refractive index ‚Üí wave bends back to Earth

**Effect**: **VHF/UHF propagation far beyond horizon** (500-2000 km)

**Conditions**: 
- Coastal regions (cool ocean, warm land)
- High-pressure systems (calm, clear weather)
- Morning/evening (temperature inversions)

**Impact**: 
- FM radio stations suddenly heard 1000 km away
- TV interference from distant stations
- Cellular interference (distant cells)

---

### Evaporation Ducts

**Common over oceans**: Humidity gradient creates duct ~10-50m above sea surface

**Effect**: Ships can communicate VHF far beyond horizon (200-500 km)

---

## Propagation Models Summary

| Model | Use Case | Frequency | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Free-space** | Satellite, LOS | All | Baseline (ideal) |
| **Two-ray** | Flat terrain, LOS/reflection | VHF+ | ¬±6 dB |
| **Okumura-Hata** | Urban/suburban cellular | 150 MHz - 2 GHz | ¬±10 dB |
| **COST-231** | Urban microcells | 800 MHz - 2 GHz | ¬±8 dB |
| **ITU-R P.1546** | Broadcast (TV/FM) | 30 MHz - 3 GHz | ¬±10 dB |
| **ITU-R P.368** | Ground wave | LF/MF/HF | ¬±5 dB |
| **Longley-Rice** | Irregular terrain | 20 MHz - 20 GHz | ¬±12 dB |
