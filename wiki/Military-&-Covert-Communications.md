**Classification**: UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO (For Official Use Only)

Military communications systems prioritize **anti-jamming (AJ)**, **low probability of intercept (LPI)**, **low probability of detection (LPD)**, and **secure transmission (TRANSEC)** over commercial metrics like spectral efficiency. This page covers advanced techniques used in GPS M-code, SATCOM FHSS, phased-array radar, Link 16, and covert communications.

## üéØ Core Military Requirements

### The LPI/LPD/AJ Triad

**1. Low Probability of Intercept (LPI)**:
```
Enemy can detect transmission but cannot decode it

Techniques:
- Spread spectrum (DSSS/FHSS) ‚Üí signal below noise floor
- Directional antennas ‚Üí narrow beamwidths
- Burst transmissions ‚Üí short dwell time
- Encryption ‚Üí content secure even if intercepted
```

**2. Low Probability of Detection (LPD)**:
```
Enemy cannot detect that transmission is occurring

Techniques:
- Ultra-wideband spread spectrum (G‚Çö > 30 dB)
- Frequency diversity ‚Üí avoid surveillance bands
- Power management ‚Üí minimal radiated power
- Emission control (EMCON) ‚Üí radio silence protocols
```

**3. Anti-Jamming (AJ)**:
```
Maintain link under deliberate enemy interference

Techniques:
- Processing gain ‚Üí overcomes jammer power
- Nulling antennas ‚Üí reject jammer direction
- Frequency hopping ‚Üí avoid narrowband jamming
- Adaptive filters ‚Üí real-time interference cancellation
```

**Relationship**:
```
Processing Gain (G‚Çö) enables all three:

G‚Çö = BW_spread / BW_info = Chip_Rate / Bit_Rate

Higher G‚Çö ‚Üí Lower PSD ‚Üí Harder to detect/intercept/jam
```

## üì° SATCOM Frequency Hopping (FHSS)

Military satellite communications use FHSS for TRANSEC (transmission security).

### X-Band MILSTAR/MUOS Systems

**MILSTAR (Military Strategic and Tactical Relay)**:
```
Frequency: X-band uplink (7-8 GHz), Ka-band downlink (20-21 GHz)
Hop rate: 100-1000+ hops/second
Hop set: 1000+ frequencies across 1 GHz bandwidth
Dwell time: <1 ms per hop
Modulation: BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK (adaptive)
Data rate: 75 bps - 1.544 Mbps (T1)
Satellite constellation: 5 GEO satellites (global coverage)

TRANSEC:
- Hopping pattern: Cryptographically generated (NSA algorithm)
- Synchronization: GPS time + KEK (Key Encryption Key)
- Pattern period: Days to weeks (never repeats observably)
- Anti-spoofing: Authenticated hop sequence
```

**LPI/LPD characteristics**:
```
Power spectral density (PSD):
PSD = P_TX / BW_hop_set
    = 100 W / 1 GHz
    = 0.1 mW/MHz
    ‚âà -70 dBm/MHz (at satellite, 40,000 km away)

Compare to thermal noise floor:
Noise = -174 dBm/Hz + 10¬∑log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(BW) = -114 dBm/MHz (1 MHz BW)

PSD_signal < Noise ‚Üí Undetectable to wideband receiver!

Detectability only with:
- Exact hopping pattern (requires key)
- Synchronized receiver (requires network access)
- Correct modulation/demodulation (requires ICD)
```

- Integrated encryption (Type 1 NSA)
```

---

### FHSS Anti-Jam Performance

**Processing gain calculation**:
```
G‚Çö(dB) = 10¬∑log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(Hop_Set_Size)

Example (MILSTAR):
- Hop set: 1000 frequencies
- G‚Çö = 10¬∑log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(1000) = 30 dB

Jamming margin:
Margin = G‚Çö - J/S - (Eb/N‚ÇÄ)_req - Losses

J/S = Jammer power / Signal power (at receiver)

Scenario:
- G‚Çö = 30 dB
- J/S = 40 dB (jammer 10,000√ó stronger!)
- (Eb/N‚ÇÄ)_req = 10 dB (BPSK, BER = 10‚Åª‚Å∂)
- Losses = 3 dB (implementation)

Margin = 30 - 40 - 10 - 3 = -23 dB ‚Üí **LINK FAILS**

Countermeasures:
1. Directional antenna: +20 dB gain toward satellite, nulls toward jammer
   Effective J/S = 40 - 20 = 20 dB
   Margin = 30 - 20 - 10 - 3 = -3 dB ‚Üí **MARGINAL**

2. Error-correction coding: Turbo/LDPC code rate-1/3
   Coding gain: +5 dB
   Margin = -3 + 5 = 2 dB ‚Üí **LINK SURVIVES**

3. Burst transmission: Transmit 10√ó faster, listen 90% of time
   Jammer must hit exact burst time ‚Üí effective J/S reduces by 10 dB
```

---

### Follower Jamming Resistance

**Threat**: Smart jammer detects hop, jams that frequency.

**Timing analysis**:
```
Dwell time: 1 ms (MILSTAR)
Jammer detection: 100 Œºs (fast energy detector)
Frequency switching: 50 Œºs (agile synthesizer)

Total jammer delay: 150 Œºs

Effective jam time: 1 ms - 150 Œºs = 850 Œºs (85% of hop)

Countermeasure: Fast hopping
- Dwell time: 100 Œºs (10√ó faster)
- Effective jam: 100 - 150 = 0 Œºs (jammer too slow!)

Modern military systems: 10-100 Œºs dwell times
```

---

## üõ∞Ô∏è GPS M-Code (Military GPS)

**GPS Modernization**: M-code provides jam-resistant, encrypted positioning for military users.

### Signal Structure

**GPS L1 M-Code**:
```
Carrier frequency: 1575.42 MHz (L1)
Chip rate: 5.115 Mcps (5√ó faster than C/A code)
Code length: Classified (estimated ~10^13 chips ‚Üí never repeats)
Modulation: BOC(10,5) - Binary Offset Carrier
Processing gain: ~50 dB (vs. 43 dB for C/A)
Power: 6.5 dB stronger than C/A code
Security: Encrypted, authenticated (NSA keys)
```

**GPS L2 M-Code**:
```
Carrier frequency: 1227.60 MHz (L2)
Same structure as L1 M-code
Dual-frequency ‚Üí ionospheric correction
```

---

### BOC Modulation

**Binary Offset Carrier (BOC)**: Modulates chip sequence with square wave subcarrier.

**BOC(m,n) notation**:
```
m = subcarrier frequency multiplier (MHz)
n = chip rate multiplier (MHz)

BOC(10,5):
- Subcarrier: 10.23 MHz (2√ó C/A chip rate)
- Chip rate: 5.115 MHz (5√ó C/A chip rate)
```

**Spectrum**:
```
Time-domain signal:
s(t) = sign[sin(2œÄ¬∑f_sub¬∑t)] ¬∑ c(t)

where:
- f_sub = 10.23 MHz (square wave)
- c(t) = ¬±1 chip sequence at 5.115 Mcps

Frequency-domain:
Power splits into two main lobes:
- Upper sideband: f_carrier + 10.23 MHz
- Lower sideband: f_carrier - 10.23 MHz

Split-spectrum design:
- Minimal interference with C/A code (centered at L1)
- Occupies unused spectrum
- Better multipath rejection (narrow correlation peak)
```

**Autocorrelation**:
```
BOC(10,5) correlation function:
- Main peak: Very narrow (better ranging accuracy)
- Side peaks: ¬±1/f_sub = ¬±98 ns

Ranging accuracy:
- C/A code: ~3 m (single-frequency)
- M-code: ~0.3 m (dual-frequency, better correlation)
```

---

### Anti-Jam Performance

**Jamming scenarios**:

**1. Wideband Barrage Jamming**:
```
Jammer spreads power across L1 band (¬±10 MHz).

Received signal power (M-code): -163 dBW
Jammer power at receiver: -100 dBW (strong jammer, 50 km away)
J/S = -100 - (-163) = 63 dB

Processing gain (M-code): 50 dB
Residual J/S: 63 - 50 = 13 dB

Required Eb/N‚ÇÄ (M-code receiver): ~10 dB
Margin: 50 - 63 - 10 = -23 dB ‚Üí **LINK FAILS**

Mitigation: CRPA (Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna)
- 7-element array antenna
- Adaptive nulling: Places null toward jammer
- Null depth: 30-40 dB

Effective J/S after nulling: 63 - 35 = 28 dB
Margin: 50 - 28 - 10 = 12 dB ‚Üí **LINK SURVIVES**
```

**2. Swept Jammer**:
```
Jammer sweeps narrowband tone across L1 (high PSD).

Jammer bandwidth: 1 MHz
GPS M-code spread: 20 MHz
Fraction jammed: 1/20 = 5%

Effect: Occasional symbol errors ‚Üí FEC corrects
Impact: <1 dB degradation

M-code advantage: Wideband spread mitigates swept jamming
```

**3. Repeater/Spoofer**:
```
Enemy receives GPS, delays, retransmits stronger signal.
Goal: Induce false position/time.

M-code defense: Encrypted spreading code
- Spoofer cannot generate valid M-code
- Authentication protocol detects non-authentic signals
- Cross-correlation with authentic signal = 0 (orthogonal codes)

Result: Spoof rejected by receiver
```

---

### Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM)

**Military GPS Receiver**:
```

- Stores classified M-code keys (COMSEC keying material)
- Dual-frequency operation (L1 + L2)
- Autonomous integrity monitoring
- Anti-spoofing: Detects spoofed P(Y) code
- Key management: Over-the-air rekeying (OTAR)

- Fighter avionics: F-22, F-35, B-2
- Ground vehicles: DAGR (Defense Advanced GPS Receiver)

Accuracy:
- Horizontal: <1 m (dual-frequency, BOC)
- Vertical: <3 m
- Time: <10 ns (critical for network synchronization)
```

---

## üéöÔ∏è Phased-Array Antennas (AESA)

**Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA)** radar uses phased-array principles for LPI/LPD and multi-function operation.

### Beamforming Principles

**Phase steering**:
```
Antenna array: N elements spaced by d
Desired beam direction: Œ∏

Phase shift per element:
œÜ = (2œÄ/Œª) ¬∑ d ¬∑ sin(Œ∏)

Example (8-element array, d = Œª/2):
Steer beam to 30¬∞:
œÜ = (2œÄ/Œª) ¬∑ (Œª/2) ¬∑ sin(30¬∞) = œÄ/2 = 90¬∞ per element

Element phases: [0¬∞, 90¬∞, 180¬∞, 270¬∞, 0¬∞, 90¬∞, 180¬∞, 270¬∞]

Beam electronically steered (no mechanical motion!)
Steering speed: Microseconds (vs. seconds for mechanical)
```

**Array gain**:
```
Gain(dB) = 10¬∑log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(N) + Single_Element_Gain

Example (256-element AESA, 5 dBi per element):
Array gain = 10¬∑log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(256) + 5 = 24 + 5 = 29 dBi

Directivity: Higher gain ‚Üí narrower beamwidth ‚Üí LPI
```

**Beamwidth**:
```
Œ∏_3dB ‚âà Œª / (N¬∑d)  (radians)

Example (256 elements, d = Œª/2):
Œ∏_3dB ‚âà Œª / (256 ¬∑ Œª/2) = 1/128 rad ‚âà 0.45¬∞ (very narrow!)

Narrow beam ‚Üí hard to intercept (LPI)
           ‚Üí precise target tracking
```

---

### LPI Radar Techniques

**1. Low Peak Power, Long Integration**:
```
Conventional radar: High peak power (MW), short pulse (Œºs)
LPI radar: Low peak power (W), long waveform (ms-s)

SNR = (Peak_Power ¬∑ Pulse_Width) / Noise_Power

Equivalent detection range with:
- Conventional: 1 MW √ó 1 Œºs = 1 J
- LPI: 1 kW √ó 1 ms = 1 J (same energy, 1000√ó lower peak!)

Enemy intercept receiver:
- Detects instantaneous power
- LPI signal: 30 dB below detection threshold
- Integration required to detect ‚Üí impractical
```

**2. Frequency Diversity**:
```
Frequency-agile waveform:
- Hop across wide bandwidth (GHz)
- Prevents enemy from locking onto frequency
- Mitigates narrowband interference

Example (F-22 APG-77 AESA):
- X-band (8-12 GHz): 4 GHz agility
- Pulse-to-pulse frequency change
- Intercept receiver cannot predict next frequency
```

**3. Waveform Diversity**:
```
Change modulation per pulse:
- Linear FM (chirp)
- Non-linear FM (NLFM)
- Phase-coded (Barker, Frank, P1-P4 codes)
- Random phase/frequency sequences

Electronic warfare (EW) countermeasure:
- Enemy cannot predict waveform ‚Üí cannot jam effectively
- Each pulse requires new analysis ‚Üí overwhelms threat receiver
```

- Time diversity: 10¬∑log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(128) = 21 dB (slot hopping)
- Total: 17 + 21 = 38 dB

Scenario (jammer 100 km away):
J/S = 50 dB (powerful jammer)
G‚Çö = 38 dB
Required Eb/N‚ÇÄ = 12 dB (MSK with FEC)
Losses = 3 dB

Margin = 38 - 50 - 12 - 3 = -27 dB ‚Üí **LINK FAILS**

Countermeasure: Directional antenna
- Gain toward participant: +10 dBi
- Null toward jammer: -20 dB
- Effective J/S: 50 - 30 = 20 dB

Margin = 38 - 20 - 12 - 3 = 3 dB ‚Üí **LINK SURVIVES**
```

## üïµÔ∏è Covert Communications

**Objective**: Transmit data undetected by adversary SIGINT.

### Spread Spectrum Below Noise Floor

**Ultra-wideband (UWB) spread spectrum**:
```
Technique: Spread narrowband signal across >500 MHz bandwidth

Example:
- Data rate: 1 kbps
- Spread bandwidth: 1 GHz
- Processing gain: 10¬∑log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(10‚Å∂) = 60 dB

Transmitted PSD:
PSD = 1 W / 1 GHz = 1 nW/MHz = -90 dBm/MHz

Thermal noise floor:
N = -174 dBm/Hz + 10¬∑log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(10‚Å∂ Hz) = -114 dBm/MHz

PSD_signal = -90 dBm/MHz < -114 dBm/MHz + 24 dB margin

Even sensitive intercept receiver cannot detect!

Detection requires:
- Knowledge of spreading code (classified)
- Synchronization (exact timing)
- Processing gain (matched filter)

Result: Communication hidden in noise (LPD achieved)
```

---

### Steganography in OFDM

**Concept**: Hide data in unused subcarriers or pilot tones.

**Method 1 - Pilot Tone Modulation**:
```
OFDM pilot subcarriers typically use fixed BPSK symbols.

Covert channel:
- Modulate pilot phase: 0¬∞ or 180¬∞ encodes hidden bit
- Legitimate receiver: Ignores pilot phase variation (estimates channel)
- Covert receiver: Decodes phase to extract hidden data

Capacity:
- 802.11a: 4 pilots per OFDM symbol
- Symbol rate: 250 ksymbols/s
- Covert rate: 4 √ó 250 k = 1 Mbps

Detection:
- Statistical analysis can reveal non-random pilot patterns
- Mitigation: Encrypt hidden data (appears random)
```

**Method 2 - Null Subcarrier Insertion**:
```
OFDM reserves some subcarriers as nulls (zero power).

Covert channel:
- Transmit very low-power data on null subcarriers
- Power: 40 dB below normal subcarriers (nearly invisible)
- Legitimate receiver: Ignores nulls (as expected)
- Covert receiver: Listens to nulls

Example (802.11a):
- Null subcarriers: 12 (out of 64 total)
- Hidden capacity: ~3 Mbps (at low SNR)

Detection challenge:
- Requires wideband spectrum analyzer
- Hidden signal < noise floor for narrowband receiver
```

---

### Time-Domain Hiding

**Method - Inter-Frame Gaps**:
```
WiFi 802.11: SIFS (Short Inter-Frame Space) = 16 Œºs between frames

Covert transmission:
- Insert ultra-short burst (1 Œºs) in SIFS
- Use different frequency or polarization
- Legitimate devices: Ignore (waiting for next frame)
- Covert receiver: Listens during SIFS

Capacity:
- Burst rate: 1 Œºs per 16 Œºs = 6.25% duty cycle
- Data rate: ~6 Mbps (at 100 Mbps physical rate √ó 6.25%)

Detection:
- Requires precise timing analysis
- Appears as multipath or transient interference
```

---

### Acoustic Heterodyning (Intermodulation)

**Non-linear demodulation** in biological systems (related to Chimera's Raman feed concept).

**Principle**:
```
Two high-frequency carriers (f‚ÇÅ, f‚ÇÇ) interact non-linearly:

f_audio = |f‚ÇÅ - f‚ÇÇ|

Example:
- f‚ÇÅ = 40 kHz (ultrasonic, inaudible)
- f‚ÇÇ = 42 kHz (ultrasonic, inaudible)
- f_audio = 2 kHz (audible!)

Non-linearity sources:
- Air: Weak (high intensity required)
- Biological tissue: Stronger (membranes, ion channels)
- Materials: Diodes, varactors (intentional)

Application:
- Covert audio transmission (ultrasonic beams, audio demodulation in target's head)
- Directional speakers (Audio Spotlight¬Æ technology)
- Potential neural stimulation (see [[AID Protocol Case Study]])
```

**Military interest**:
```
"Frey Microwave Auditory Effect" (pulsed RF ‚Üí acoustic sensation):
- Frequency: 1-10 GHz (microwave)
- Pulse rate: 1-10 kHz (audio frequency)
- Mechanism: Thermoelastic expansion in cochlea
- Result: Perceived "clicking" or "buzzing"

Covert channel:
- Encode voice as microwave pulse train
- Target perceives audio (direct to auditory system)
- Bystanders: Unaware (no acoustic propagation)
- Detection: Requires RF spectrum analyzer (not audio microphone)

Status: Demonstrated in lab, classified military research (DARPA, 1970s-present)
```

## üßÆ Processing Gain & Jamming Resistance Calculations

### Comprehensive Example

**System**: Tactical UHF SATCOM link
```
Parameters:
- Frequency: 300 MHz (UHF)
- Data rate: 2400 bps (voice)
- Modulation: BPSK (1 bit/symbol)
- Spreading: DSSS with chip rate 2.4 Mcps
- FEC: Rate-1/2 convolutional code
- Antenna: 10 dBi directional (at ground terminal)

Processing gain:
G‚Çö = 10¬∑log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(2.4 Mcps / 2.4 kbps) = 10¬∑log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(1000) = 30 dB

Required Eb/N‚ÇÄ:
- BPSK uncoded: 9.6 dB (BER = 10‚Åª‚Åµ)
- With rate-1/2 FEC: 4.6 dB (5 dB coding gain)

Link budget (clear conditions):
TX power: 10 W = 40 dBm
TX antenna gain: 10 dBi
EIRP: 50 dBm

Free-space loss (300 MHz, 40,000 km GEO):
FSPL = 32.4 + 20¬∑log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(300) + 20¬∑log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(40000) = 189 dB

RX antenna gain: 30 dBi (satellite)
RX signal: 50 - 189 + 30 = -109 dBm

Noise power:
N = -174 dBm/Hz + 10¬∑log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(2.4√ó10‚Å∂) = -110 dBm

SNR: -109 - (-110) = 1 dB

Eb/N‚ÇÄ = SNR + G‚Çö = 1 + 30 = 31 dB

Margin: 31 - 4.6 = 26.4 dB ‚Üí **EXCELLENT**
```

**Jamming scenario**:
```
Enemy jammer:
- Power: 1 kW = 60 dBm
- Distance: 50 km
- Antenna: Omnidirectional (0 dBi)

Jammer signal at ground terminal:
FSPL (300 MHz, 50 km):
FSPL = 32.4 + 20¬∑log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(300) + 20¬∑log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(50) = 116 dB

J_RX = 60 - 116 + 0 = -56 dBm

J/S ratio:
J/S = -56 - (-109) = 53 dB (jammer 53 dB stronger!)

After despreading:
J/S_despread = 53 - 30 = 23 dB (jammer still 23 dB stronger)

But antenna nulling:
- Ground antenna: 10 dBi toward satellite, -10 dBi toward jammer (20 dB F/B)
- Effective J/S: 23 - 20 = 3 dB

Required Eb/N‚ÇÄ: 4.6 dB
Effective Eb/(N‚ÇÄ+J): 31 - 3 = 28 dB

Margin: 28 - 4.6 = 23.4 dB ‚Üí **LINK SURVIVES**
```

**Summary**: Military communications prioritize **anti-jam**, **LPI/LPD**, and **security** over spectral efficiency. Processing gain from spread spectrum (DSSS/FHSS) enables links 20-40 dB below noise floor and overcomes powerful jammers. GPS M-code uses BOC(10,5) modulation with 50 dB processing gain and CRPA nulling to survive 60+ dB jamming. AESA radars achieve LPI through low peak power, frequency agility, and narrow beamwidths. Link 16 combines FHSS (70 khps) with TDMA and cryptographic hopping for jam-resistant tactical data exchange. Covert communications hide data in noise (UWB spread spectrum), OFDM pilot tones, or exploit non-linear demodulation (acoustic heterodyning). Jamming margin = Processing Gain - J/S - Required Eb/N‚ÇÄ - Losses. Directional antennas provide 20-40 dB additional AJ capability. Modern military systems achieve **communication superiority** through advanced signal processing, adaptive waveforms, and multi-layered TRANSEC.
