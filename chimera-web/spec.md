**DOCUMENT TITLE:** Raman Whisper Modulation Protocol v4.2
**CLASSIFICATION:** [SEC=SECRET] // [RD/TNWDI]
**LAST REVISION:** 2025-01-20

**Modulation of the 12.0 kHz Auditory Carrier:**
The core "sound" is a 12.0 kHz sine wave. The Gnostic "data" is not encoded on the THz carrier; it is encoded on this auditory-range carrier, which is then amplitude-modulated onto the THz "whisper signal."

**Modulation Parameters:**
*   **Modulation Scheme:** Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK) with a nested, low-rate Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK) layer. This is a non-standard protocol optimized for psychoacoustic impact, not data throughput.
*   **QPSK Layer (Framing and Symbol Rate):**
    *   **Symbol Rate:** 16 symbols per second. Optimized for stability and bypassing cognitive filters.
    *   **Bandwidth:** Approximately 20 Hz, centered on the 12.0 kHz carrier.
    *   **Framing:** Transmitted in 128-symbol frames.
        *   16-symbol synchronization sequence.
        *   16-symbol Target ID (unique Gnostic signature).
        *   16-symbol Command Type (e.g., "Gnostic Inject," "Ontological Nudge," "Surveillance Query").
        *   64-symbol data payload.
        *   16-symbol error-checking code.
*   **FSK Layer (Gnostic Data):**
    *   The 12.0 kHz carrier is deliberately "dithered" using a binary FSK.
    *   Frequency for binary "0": 11,999 Hz.
    *   Frequency for binary "1": 12,001 Hz.
    *   **Data Rate:** 1 bit per second. The slowness is intentional, designed for subconscious informational osmosis.

**DOCUMENT TITLE:** Project Chimera: Biophysical Coupling Mechanism
**CLASSIFICATION:** [SEC=TOP SECRET] // [SCI/TK]

**OVERVIEW:**
This document details the primary physical mechanism for the Auditory Intermodulation Distortion (AID) effect. The mechanism is non-thermal and non-thermoelastic.

**PRIMARY BIOLOGICAL TARGET:**
The primary biological target for the CHIMERA field is the **microtubule lattice within cortical neurons,** specifically in the primary auditory cortex.

**MECHANISM OF ACTION:**
The dual THz carriers are holographically shaped to create a resonant interference pattern that couples directly to the collective vibrational modes of the microtubule network. The objective is to **induce and manipulate vibronic quantum coherence** within the tubulin dimers. The modulated 12 kHz signal does not carry information in the classical sense; it is a **perturbation frequency** designed to directly alter the timing of the **Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR) collapse sequence.** The perceived "sound" is the conscious experience of this forced, externally-driven perturbation of the quantum computational process. The Pump Beam functions to maintain coherence and delay environmental decoherence, increasing the efficiency of the coupling.
