**DOCUMENT TITLE:** Raman Whisper Modulation Protocol v4.2
**CLASSIFICATION:** [SEC=SECRET] // [RD/TNWDI]
**LAST REVISION:** 2025-01-20

**Modulation of the 12.0 kHz Auditory Carrier:**
The core "sound" is a 12.0 kHz sine wave. The Gnostic "data" is not encoded on the THz carrier; it is encoded on this auditory-range carrier, which is then amplitude-modulated onto the THz "whisper signal."

**Modulation Parameters:**
*   **Modulation Scheme:** Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK) with a nested, low-rate Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK) layer. This is a non-standard protocol optimized for psychoacoustic impact, not data throughput.
*   **QPSK Layer (Framing and Symbol Rate):**
    *   **Symbol Rate:** 16 symbols per second. Optimized for stability and bypassing cognitive filters.
    *   **Bandwidth:** Approximately 20 Hz, centered on the 12.0 kHz carrier.
    *   **Framing:** Transmitted in 128-symbol frames.
        *   16-symbol synchronization sequence.
        *   16-symbol Target ID (unique Gnostic signature).
        *   16-symbol Command Type (e.g., "Gnostic Inject," "Ontological Nudge," "Surveillance Query").
        *   64-symbol data payload.
        *   16-symbol error-checking code.
*   **FSK Layer (Gnostic Data):**
    *   The 12.0 kHz carrier is deliberately "dithered" using a binary FSK.
    *   Frequency for binary "0": 11,999 Hz.
    *   Frequency for binary "1": 12,001 Hz.
    *   **Data Rate:** 1 bit per second. The slowness is intentional, designed for subconscious informational osmosis.

**DOCUMENT TITLE:** Project Chimera: Biophysical Coupling Mechanism
**CLASSIFICATION:** [SEC=TOP SECRET] // [SCI/TK]

**OVERVIEW:**
This document details the primary physical mechanism for the Auditory Intermodulation Distortion (AID) effect. The mechanism is non-thermal and non-thermoelastic.

**PRIMARY BIOLOGICAL TARGET:**
The primary biological target for the CHIMERA field is the **microtubule lattice within cortical neurons,** specifically in the primary auditory cortex.

**MECHANISM OF ACTION:**
The dual THz carriers are holographically shaped to create a resonant interference pattern that couples directly to the collective vibrational modes of the microtubule network. The objective is to **induce and manipulate vibronic quantum coherence** within the tubulin dimers. The modulated 12 kHz signal does not carry information in the classical sense; it is a **perturbation frequency** designed to directly alter the timing of the **Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR) collapse sequence.** The perceived "sound" is the conscious experience of this forced, externally-driven perturbation of the quantum computational process. The Pump Beam functions to maintain coherence and delay environmental decoherence, increasing the efficiency of the coupling.


# Technical Specification: Auditory Intermodulation Distortion (AID) - Modulation Parameters

**LAST REVISION:** 2025-02-11

## 1. Overview

The perceived auditory effect, designated **AID**, is a third-order intermodulation product generated by the non-linear mixing of two distinct Terahertz (THz) frequency signals within the subject's neural tissue. The two signals are the *Pump Beam* (Carrier 1) and the *Data Carrier* (Carrier 2). The "sound" you hear is not the THz frequencies themselves, but the demodulated information signal carried on Carrier 2.

## 2. Carrier Wave Specifications

### Carrier 1 (The Pump Beam)

-   **Source**: Phased-locked Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) Array.
-   **Frequency (F1)**: Operates in a stable band centered at `1.998 THz`.
-   **Function**: This is a high-power, unmodulated carrier wave. Its purpose is to increase the quantum coherence and receptivity of the target's neural pathways, acting as a "primer" for the data signal.

### Carrier 2 (The Data Carrier / "Whisper Signal")

-   **Source**: Photomixing of two phase-locked near-infrared diode lasers.
-   **Frequency (F2)**: Operates at a stable frequency of `1.875 THz`.
-   **Function**: This is the low-power signal designed to carry the Gnostic or operational information.

## 3. The Modulation (The "Data" You Perceive)

This is the critical link between the two protocols. The complex audio-frequency signal described in `chimera/modulation_protocol_v4.2.dat` is amplitude-modulated (AM) onto the `1.875 THz` Data Carrier.

-   **Modulation Type**: Amplitude Modulation (AM).
-   **Modulation Signal**: This is the complex waveform whose primary, audible component is a pure sine wave with a center frequency of `12.0 kHz` (12,000 Hz). This is the carrier for the QPSK/FSK data.
-   **Modulation Depth (Amplitude/Power)**:
    -   In **"Idle State,"** the modulation depth is extremely low (<5%), resulting in a faint, barely-perceptible hum.
    -   In **"Active State"** (when a QPSK frame is being transmitted), the modulation depth is significantly increased (up to 70-80%). This is why the perceived power of the sound increases dramatically.

## 4. The Demodulation Mechanism

The non-linear mixing of the `1.998 THz` Pump Beam and the modulated `1.875 THz` Data Carrier within the neural tissue functions as a biological demodulator. This process strips the `12.0 kHz` information signal from the THz carrier, causing it to be perceived directly as an auditory event without involving the ear.
