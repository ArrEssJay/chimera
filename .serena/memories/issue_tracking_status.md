## üìä Status Summary
- **Total Issues:** 22 open (Epic #40)
- **Wave 1 Assigned:** 5 issues (#47, #54, #55, #56, #58)
- **Wave 2 Ready:** 5 issues (#48, #49, #50, #51, #52)
- **Wave 3+ Blocked:** 7 issues (awaiting Wave 2 completion)
- **Critical Priority:** 2 issues (#47, #52)
- **High Priority:** 6 issues

## üéØ Parallelization Strategy

### Key Insight: Contract-First Development
By using locked contract files (`contracts/node-types.ts`, `contracts/node-trait.rs`), we can:
- Run 5 agents in parallel without file conflicts
- Each agent owns distinct files
- TypeScript/Rust type checking catches integration issues
- No merge conflicts from concurrent work

### Wave Strategy
1. **Wave 1 (Current):** Foundation + infrastructure work that doesn't block
2. **Wave 2:** Core engine + graph editor (after #47)
3. **Wave 3:** Integration + polish (after Wave 2)
4. **Wave 4:** Production deployment (after Wave 3)

**Velocity Gain:** ~70% reduction in calendar time through parallelization!

## üîÑ Workflow Notes

### Human Role (You)
- Strategic planning & prioritization ‚úÖ
- Review PRs from AI agents
- Handle architectural decisions
- Merge conflicts (if any)
- Approve wave transitions

### AI Agent (GitHub Copilot) Role
- Implement features per issue assignment ‚úÖ
- Follow contract-first development ‚úÖ
- Maintain test coverage ‚â•80%
- Auto-create PRs when work complete
- Comment on progress

### VSCode Copilot + Serena Role (Me)
- Real-time coding assistance
- Issue triage and assignment ‚úÖ
- Memory updates ‚úÖ
- Quick fixes and exploratory work
- Coordinate parallel work

## üí° Key Patterns

### Issue Assignment
- Issues with `Copilot` assignee ‚Üí AI agent working
- Issues with assignment comment ‚Üí Clear file ownership
- Issues without assignee ‚Üí Available for next wave

### Labels Guide
- **Phase labels:** phase-1-foundation, phase-2-core, phase-3-state, phase-4-polish, phase-5-deploy
- **Priority:** critical, high, medium, low
- **Type:** feature, infrastructure, bugfix, testing, docs, cleanup, performance
- **Category:** frontend, ui, epic

### File Ownership (Critical for Parallel Work)
Each agent gets exclusive ownership of specific files to prevent conflicts:
- **Agent 1 (#47):** `chimera-core/src/node_graph.rs`, etc.
- **Agent 2 (#54):** `chimera-web/src/styles/responsive.css`, etc.
- **Agent 3 (#55):** `docs/*.md`, JSDoc comments
- **Agent 4 (#56):** `.github/workflows/chromatic.yml`, etc.
- **Agent 5 (#58):** `vite.config.prod.ts`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

**Zero file overlap = zero conflicts!**

---

## üéØ Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ Parallel development active (5 agents Wave 1)
- ‚úÖ Contract-first preventing conflicts
- ‚è≥ High test coverage maintained (agents responsible)
- ‚è≥ GitOps automation working smoothly (will validate with PRs)

---

## üìã Next Actions
1. **Monitor Wave 1 PRs** - Watch for completion
2. **Prepare Wave 2 assignments** - #48, #49, #51 ready to go
3. **Review and merge PRs** - Human approval needed
4. **Launch Wave 2** - As soon as #47 completes
5. **Update this memory** - Track progress

**Status:** üü¢ Wave 1 active - 5 agents working in parallel!
