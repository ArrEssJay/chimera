## 🎯 Branch Protection Rules

### Main Branch Protection
**Status:** ✅ Configured
**User Benefit:** Prevents breaking changes from reaching production

**Settings:**
- ✅ Require pull request before merging (0 approvals for auto-merge)
- ✅ Require status checks to pass:
  - `detect-conflicts` (prevent merge conflicts = stable UX)
  - `verify-contracts-locked` (API stability = no breaking changes)
  - `validate-component` (UI PRs - protect user interface quality)
  - `rust-validation` (Rust PRs - no panics = no crashes for users)
  - `node-unit-test` (node PRs - catch bugs before users)
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date
- ✅ Require linear history (clean history = easier debugging for users)
- ✅ Require conversation resolution
- ❌ Force pushes disabled (protect history = protect users)
- ❌ Deletions disabled (protect main = protect users)

**Required Checks Defined In:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Tests, formatting, clippy, web build
- `.github/workflows/test-deploy.yml` - Test deployment verification
- `.github/workflows/contract-enforcement.yml` - Contract protection (user stability)
- `.github/workflows/conflict-detection.yml` - Parallel work conflicts

**Why This Matters:** Users trust us. Every quality gate honors that trust.

## 🔒 GitHub Rulesets

### Ruleset 1: Contract Protection (via CODEOWNERS)
**Status:** ✅ Active
**User Benefit:** API stability = no breaking changes = reliable user experience

**Protected Paths:**
- `contracts/**` - All contract files locked
- Requires code owner approval for changes
- CI workflow `verify-contracts-locked` enforces

**CODEOWNERS Configuration:**
```
# Contract files are locked - protect user experience
/contracts/ @ArrEssJay
```

### Ruleset 2: Copilot Review
**Status:** ✅ Active (pre-existing)
- "Copilot review for default branch"

---

## 🔐 Security Configuration

### GitHub Copilot Allowlist
**Path:** Repository Settings → Copilot → Coding agent settings
**Status:** ⚠️ Needs Manual Configuration
**User Benefit:** Secure development = no compromised code = safe for users

**Required URLs:**
```
# Package Registries
npmjs.com
registry.npmjs.org
crates.io
static.crates.io

# Documentation
developer.mozilla.org
docs.rs
doc.rust-lang.org
storybook.js.org
playwright.dev
jestjs.io

# Build Tools & CDNs
cdn.jsdelivr.net
unpkg.com
rustwasm.github.io
chromatic.com
```

**How to Configure:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/ArrEssJay/chimera/settings/copilot
2. Click "Edit allowlist"
3. Add each URL above
4. Save

## 🚀 CI/CD Workflows

### Active Workflows

**`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**
- Runs on: All pushes, PRs to main
- Jobs: test, fmt, clippy, build-web
- **User Benefit:** Catch bugs before users do

**`.github/workflows/test-deploy.yml`**
- Runs on: PRs to main
- Validates deployment artifacts
- **User Benefit:** Ensure production deployment works

**`.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml`**
- Runs on: PR approval
- Auto-merges if all checks pass
- **User Benefit:** Fast delivery = users get features sooner

**`.github/workflows/contract-enforcement.yml`**
- Runs on: PRs
- Blocks contract file modifications
- **User Benefit:** API stability = no breaking changes for users

**`.github/workflows/conflict-detection.yml`**
- Runs on: PRs
- Detects file ownership conflicts
- **User Benefit:** Parallel dev = multiple features delivered simultaneously

---

## 📦 Dependabot Configuration
**Status:** ✅ Active
**User Benefit:** Security updates = safe tool for users

**File:** `.github/dependabot.yml`
**Monitors:**
- Cargo dependencies (weekly)
- npm dependencies (weekly)
- GitHub Actions (weekly)

---

## 🔧 MCP Server Configuration

### Integrated Servers

**1. GitHub MCP (Built-in)**
- Issue management (track user needs)
- PR creation/review
- Repository metadata

**2. Serena MCP (Active)**
- Symbolic code search (speed = faster user value)
- Memory management (efficiency)
- File operations

**Configuration:** `.serena/config.json`

### Recommended Additional Servers

**3. Context7 MCP**
- Library documentation access
- Usage: `@context7 react-flow-renderer`

**4. Filesystem MCP**
- Enhanced file operations
- Restricted to: `chimera-web/src`, `chimera-core/src`, `contracts`

---

## ✅ Completed Setup

- ✅ CODEOWNERS file (`.github/CODEOWNERS`) - protect contracts = protect users
- ✅ Dependabot configuration - security = user safety
- ✅ Auto-merge workflow - speed = faster user value
- ✅ Contract enforcement workflow - stability = reliable UX
- ✅ Quality gate workflows (6 total) - quality = user trust
- ✅ Contract files locked - API stability = no breaking changes
- ✅ Custom Copilot instructions - consistency = quality
- ✅ Serena MCP integration - efficiency = faster delivery

---

## ⏳ Pending Manual Steps

### Priority 1: Copilot Allowlist
**Action Required:** Add URLs to allowlist (see above)
**Blocks:** External resource access in agent code
**User Impact:** Secure development environment

### Priority 2: Verify Branch Protection
**Action Required:** Confirm ruleset in GitHub UI
**URL:** https://github.com/ArrEssJay/chimera/settings/rules
**User Impact:** Ensure main branch protected from mistakes

---

## 📋 Quick Setup Commands

### Check Current Rulesets
```bash
gh ruleset list
```

### View Branch Protection
```bash
gh api repos/ArrEssJay/chimera/branches/main/protection
```

### List Active Workflows
```bash
gh workflow list
```

### Check Recent Workflow Runs
```bash
gh run list --limit 10
```

## 🎯 GitOps Workflow Overview

### Feature Branch → Main (User Value Delivery Path)
1. Developer/Agent creates feature branch
2. Makes changes, pushes
3. CI validates (tests, format, lint, build) **[Protect users from bugs]**
4. Creates PR to main
5. All status checks must pass **[Quality gate for users]**
6. Auto-merge if approved **[Fast delivery to users]**
7. Deploy workflow updates production **[Users get feature!]**

### Parallel Work Safety (Maximize User Value)
- File ownership prevents conflicts
- Contract enforcement via CI (stability for users)
- Conflict detection blocks overlapping PRs
- Feature branches isolated until validated
- **Result:** Multiple features delivered to users simultaneously

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check Repository Health
```bash
# See open PRs (user value in pipeline)
gh pr list --state open

# See recent issues (user needs and pain points)
gh issue list --limit 20

# Check CI status (quality gates protecting users)
gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --limit 5
```

### Validate Configuration
```bash
# Ensure workflows are active (protect users)
ls -la .github/workflows/

# Verify contract protection (stability for users)
cat .github/CODEOWNERS

# Check Serena setup (efficiency for users)
ls -la .serena/
```
