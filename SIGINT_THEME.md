- Rajdhani (clean technical sans)
- All-caps emphasis for technical readouts
- Increased letter-spacing for readability

### UI Elements

#### Buttons
**Before:** Rounded pills with soft shadows
**After:** Angular tactical switches with:
- Inset beveled edges
- Tactical border glow
- Military-grade activation states
- All-caps labels with wide letter spacing

#### Panels
**Before:** Rounded corners (16px), soft borders
**After:** 
- Sharp corners (0px radius)
- Tactical corner brackets (top-left, bottom-right)
- Inset border highlights
- Professional military panel styling

#### Charts
**Before:** Clean minimal backgrounds
**After:**
- Grid overlay patterns (oscilloscope-style)
- Scanline effects
- Tactical color scheme (green for TX, cyan for RX)
- Radar/scope aesthetic
- Technical readout styling

#### Badges & Status Indicators
**Before:** Rounded badges with soft colors
**After:**
- Angular tactical indicators
- Pulsing glow animations
- All-caps labels
- Military status color coding

#### Tables
**Before:** Subtle rounded styling
**After:**
- Sharp technical readout format
- Accent-colored headers with arrows
- Hover states with tactical highlighting
- Monospace data cells

### Background Effects
**Before:** Soft radial gradients
**After:**
- Grid overlay (40px squares)
- Scanline effects (subtle horizontal lines)
- Tactical corner accents
- Professional workbench appearance

### Animations
**Before:** Smooth, organic transitions
**After:**
- Pulsing tactical indicators
- Sharp, precise transitions
- Glow effects on active elements
- Military-grade status animations

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Changes
- Replaced all rounded corners with sharp angles
- Updated color variables to tactical palette (LCH color space)
- Added grid and scanline overlays using repeating gradients
- Implemented corner bracket pseudo-elements on panels and nodes
- Enhanced box-shadow effects for tactical depth and glow
- Added tactical status utility classes
- Imported Google Fonts: Share Tech Mono, Orbitron, Rajdhani

### Rust/Plotters Changes
- Updated chart caption fonts to Share Tech Mono
- Changed constellation point colors:
  - TX: Tactical green (120, 220, 150)
  - RX: Tactical cyan (120, 200, 240)
- Updated mesh grid colors to tactical green palette
- Modified default accent colors for line charts

### HTML
- Updated page title to "CHIMERA | SIGINT Workbench"
- Added meta description: "Advanced Low Probability of Intercept & Detection Signal Processing Training"

## Design Inspiration
The new design draws from:
- Military radar/sonar displays
- Intelligence agency workstations (NSA, GCHQ style)
- Oscilloscope/spectrum analyzer UIs
- Terminal/command-line interfaces
- Tactical operations centers (TOC)
- SIGINT (Signals Intelligence) equipment
- Mil-spec user interfaces

## Result
A professional, high-information-density interface that looks like it belongs in a classified military signals intelligence facility, perfectly matching the advanced signal processing nature of the Chimera project. The interface now conveys:

- **Authority**: Military-grade professionalism
- **Precision**: Technical accuracy and attention to detail
- **Intelligence**: Sophisticated data analysis capabilities
- **Stealth**: Covert operations aesthetic matching the LPI/LPD protocol
- **Power**: Advanced signal processing capabilities

The transformation successfully aligns the visual presentation with the project's focus on signals intelligence, covert communications, and advanced DSP techniques.
