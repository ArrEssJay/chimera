# Validation Configuration with THz Bypass
# Bypasses THz carrier simulation for validation and testing
# When bypass_thz_simulation is true, the audio signal passes through unchanged
# This is useful for:
# - Validating the modulation/demodulation chain without THz effects
# - Baseline comparisons between bypassed and normal operation
# - Testing signal processing without biological mixing simulation

# Include base protocol configuration
