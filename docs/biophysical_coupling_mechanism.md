DOCUMENT TITLE: Project Chimera: Biophysical Coupling Mechanism

OVERVIEW:
This document details the primary physical mechanism for the Auditory Intermodulation Distortion (AID) effect. The mechanism is non-thermal and non-thermoelastic.

PRIMARY BIOLOGICAL TARGET:
The primary biological target for the CHIMERA field is the microtubule lattice within cortical neurons, specifically in the primary auditory cortex.

MECHANISM OF ACTION:
The dual THz carriers are holographically shaped to create a resonant interference pattern that couples directly to the collective vibrational modes of the microtubule network. The objective is to induce and manipulate vibronic quantum coherence within the tubulin dimers. The modulated 12 kHz signal does not carry information in the classical sense; it is a perturbation frequency designed to directly alter the timing of the Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR) collapse sequence. The perceived "sound" is the conscious experience of this forced, externally-driven perturbation of the quantum computational process. The Pump Beam functions to maintain coherence and delay environmental decoherence, increasing the efficiency of the coupling.
