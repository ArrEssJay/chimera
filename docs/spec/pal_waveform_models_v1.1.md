## 1.0 Overview

This document details the core generative and selection algorithms used by the Protocol Abstraction Layer (PAL) to compile GOCS commands into a complete transmission signal, comprising both the high-frequency QPSK `Data Payload` and the low-frequency FSK state.

The fundamental principle is **Biomimetic Waveform Synthesis**. The models generate complex waveforms that mimic or disrupt natural neural oscillations (brainwaves) while setting a persistent, subliminal FSK tone to enhance and sustain the desired cognitive effect.

## 2.0 Model 1: Phase Rotation Sequence Generation (QPSK)

The 32-bit `Phase Rotation Sequence` is the most critical component, defining the fundamental geometry of the quantum interference pattern. It is generated by sampling a primary Low-Frequency Oscillator (`LFO_Phase`) at the system's symbol rate (16 Hz).

*   **Algorithm:** `GeneratePhaseSequence(target_freq, waveform_shape)`
*   **Process:** The algorithm steps through 16 time slices (one per symbol), samples the `LFO_Phase` at each point, and quantizes the analog value (-1.0 to +1.0) into one of four 2-bit QPSK phase states.
*   **Waveform Shapes:** `SINE` (Coherence), `SAWTOOTH` (Tension), `SQUARE` (Forcing), `NOISE` (Disruption).

## 3.0 Model 2: Vibrational Texture Generation (QPSK)

This refers to the combined effect of the `Frequency Modulation Envelope` and `Amplitude Modulation Pattern`, which are also generated by sampling secondary LFOs (`LFO_Freq`, `LFO_Amp`). These 32-bit fields add subtlety and character to the primary phase sequence.

*   **Frequency Modulation:** Adds a feeling of "vibrational texture" (e.g., a gentle "chorus" or a harsh "jitter").
*   **Amplitude Modulation:** Controls the dynamic intensity, creating a "breathing" or "pulsing" sensation.

## 4.0 Model 3: FSK State Selection Logic

Unlike the generative models for the QPSK payload, this is a **state selection model**. The FSK state is persistent and operates independently of the 16 Hz symbol rate. The PAL selects the appropriate state based on the GOCS command and the chosen Base Pattern, then issues a single command to the HCI.

### 4.1 Algorithm: `SelectFSKState()`

```python
# Pseudocode for the PAL FSK state selection
function SelectFSKState(gocs_command, base_pattern, operator_override=None):
  # Priority 1: Direct operator override from the GOCS console
  if operator_override is not None:
    return operator_override
  
  # Priority 2: Use the default state defined in the selected base pattern
  else:
    return base_pattern.default_fsk_state
```

### 4.2 FSK State Cognitive & Biophysical Purpose

| FSK State | Carrier Frequency | Biophysical Purpose | Cognitive Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **State '0'** | 11,999 Hz | **Baseline Resonance:** Maintains a passive, low-energy lock on the target's microtubule lattice. | Neutral, observational. Minimizes active influence. |
| **State '1'** | 12,001 Hz | **Maximize Coupling:** Slightly increases the resonant energy transfer, making the QPSK pattern's effect more potent. | Assertive, forceful. Enhances the directness of an effect. |
| **0/1 Alt (0.5 Hz)** | Alternating | **Theta Entrainment:** Creates a slow 0.5 Hz beat frequency that subliminally encourages brainwaves to enter the Theta state (4-8 Hz). | Hypnagogic, calming, suggestive. Lowers cognitive defenses. |
| **Random** | Random | **Decoherence Field:** Introduces low-frequency, aperiodic noise to the baseline resonance, inhibiting stable thought patterns. | Disruptive, confusing. Creates underlying "mental static." |

## 5.0 Concrete Examples: From GOCS Intent to Full Signal

### Example A: `induceCalm(intensity=0.7)` using `COH.ThetaCalm`

*   **Intent:** Guide the target into a calm, Theta-wave dominant state.
*   **PAL Compilation:**
    *   **Phase Sequence:** Generates a smooth, 6 Hz `SINE` wave QPSK pattern.
    *   **Vibrational Texture:** Generates slow, gentle sine waves for frequency and amplitude modulation.
    *   **FSK State:** The `COH.ThetaCalm` pattern defaults to `0/1 ALT (0.5 Hz)` to create a subliminal theta beat, enhancing the calming effect.

### Example B: `disruptCognition(level=0.9)` using `DIS.CognitiveScramble`

*   **Intent:** Inundate the target's prefrontal cortex with chaotic signals.
*   **PAL Compilation:**
    *   **Phase Sequence:** Generates a non-repeating, 25 Hz `NOISE` wave QPSK pattern.
    *   **Vibrational Texture:** Generates fast, chaotic noise LFOs for frequency and amplitude modulation to create harsh jitter.
    *   **FSK State:** The `DIS.CognitiveScramble` pattern defaults to `RANDOM`, creating low-frequency chaotic noise that further inhibits coherent thought.
