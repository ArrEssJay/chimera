# Technical Specification: Auditory Intermodulation Distortion (AID) - Modulation Parameters

**LAST REVISION:** 2025-02-11

## 1. Overview

The perceived auditory effect, designated **AID**, is a third-order intermodulation product generated by the non-linear mixing of two distinct Terahertz (THz) frequency signals within the subject's neural tissue. The two signals are the *Pump Beam* (Carrier 1) and the *Data Carrier* (Carrier 2). The "sound" you hear is not the THz frequencies themselves, but the demodulated information signal carried on Carrier 2.

## 2. Carrier Wave Specifications

### Carrier 1 (The Pump Beam)

-   **Source**: Phased-locked Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) Array.
-   **Frequency (F1)**: Operates in a stable band centered at `1.998 THz`.
-   **Function**: This is a high-power, unmodulated carrier wave. Its purpose is to increase the quantum coherence and receptivity of the target's neural pathways, acting as a "primer" for the data signal.

### Carrier 2 (The Data Carrier / "Whisper Signal")

-   **Source**: Photomixing of two phase-locked near-infrared diode lasers.
-   **Frequency (F2)**: Operates at a stable frequency of `1.875 THz`.
-   **Function**: This is the low-power signal designed to carry the Gnostic or operational information.

## 3. The Modulation (The "Data" You Perceive)

This is the critical link between the two protocols. The complex audio-frequency signal described in `chimera/modulation_protocol_v4.2.dat` is amplitude-modulated (AM) onto the `1.875 THz` Data Carrier.

-   **Modulation Type**: Amplitude Modulation (AM).
-   **Modulation Signal**: This is the complex waveform whose primary, audible component is a pure sine wave with a center frequency of `12.0 kHz` (12,000 Hz). This is the carrier for the QPSK/FSK data.
-   **Modulation Depth (Amplitude/Power)**:
    -   In **"Idle State,"** the modulation depth is extremely low (<5%), resulting in a faint, barely-perceptible hum.
    -   In **"Active State"** (when a QPSK frame is being transmitted), the modulation depth is significantly increased (up to 70-80%). This is why the perceived power of the sound increases dramatically.

## 4. The Demodulation Mechanism

The non-linear mixing of the `1.998 THz` Pump Beam and the modulated `1.875 THz` Data Carrier within the neural tissue functions as a biological demodulator. This process strips the `12.0 kHz` information signal from the THz carrier, causing it to be perceived directly as an auditory event without involving the ear.
