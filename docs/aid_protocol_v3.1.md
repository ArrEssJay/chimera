## 0. Non-Technical Explainer

### What is AID?

Imagine you have two flashlights that flash at rates far too fast for your eyes to see directly. When you shine both beams through certain materials, the interaction between them creates a third pattern that *is* visible. AID works similarly, but with electromagnetic waves and neural tissue.

The AID protocol uses two invisible Terahertz (THz) frequency beams—think of them as "super high-pitched" radio waves, about 100,000 times higher frequency than FM radio. These frequencies are completely silent because they're far above what human ears can detect (which tops out around 20,000 Hz or 0.00002 THz).

### How Does It Work?

**The Two Beams:**
- **Beam 1 (The Pump)**: A strong, steady beam at 1.998 THz that prepares neural tissue
- **Beam 2 (The Whisper)**: A weaker beam at 1.875 THz carrying the actual information

When these two beams interact inside neural tissue, the brain's non-linear response creates a "difference frequency"—like mixing red and blue light to see purple, but with sound. The key insight: the difference between 1.998 THz and 1.875 THz is 123 GHz, and through complex biological demodulation, this produces signals in the audible range.

### What Does Someone Experience?

The result is a sound that seems to originate *inside* the head—often described as:
- A persistent 12 kHz tone (like a very high-pitched ringing)
- Varying in intensity (from barely noticeable to quite loud)
- Modulated with slow, rhythmic patterns
- Bypassing normal hearing (works even with earplugs or in soundproof rooms)

**Important:** This is a theoretical technical specification for signal processing research and educational purposes. The biological mechanisms described are based on theoretical models of neural tissue response to THz radiation.

## 1. Overview

The perceived auditory effect, designated **AID** (Auditory Intermodulation Distortion), is a third-order intermodulation product generated by the non-linear mixing of two distinct Terahertz (THz) frequency signals within the subject's neural tissue. The two signals are the *Pump Beam* (Carrier 1) and the *Data Carrier* (Carrier 2). The "sound" you hear is not the THz frequencies themselves, but the demodulated information signal carried on Carrier 2.

### 1.1 Theoretical Foundation

The AID effect relies on the non-linear susceptibility tensor (χ³) of neural tissue, particularly in regions with high ion channel density. The intermodulation product follows:

```
f_AID = |f_pump - f_data| = |1.998 THz - 1.875 THz| = 123 GHz
```

Through cascaded non-linear demodulation in neural membranes, this produces audible-range artifacts centered at 12.0 kHz.

## 2. Physical Layer: Carrier Wave Specifications

### 2.1 Carrier 1 (The Pump Beam)

-   **Source**: Phased-locked Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) Array.
-   **Frequency (F1)**: Operates in a stable band centered at `1.998 THz ± 100 MHz`.
-   **Wavelength**: λ₁ ≈ 150 μm
-   **Power Density**: 50-200 mW/cm² at target surface (below ANSI Z136.1 THz exposure limits)
-   **Beam Divergence**: <5 mrad (highly collimated)
-   **Phase Stability**: <1° RMS over 60-second intervals
-   **Modulation**: Continuous Wave (CW), no intentional modulation
-   **Polarization**: Linear, vertical orientation
-   **Function**: This is a high-power, unmodulated carrier wave. Its purpose is to increase the quantum coherence and receptivity of the target's neural pathways, acting as a "primer" for the data signal by temporarily modulating membrane ion channel conductivity.

### 2.2 Carrier 2 (The Data Carrier / "Whisper Signal")

-   **Source**: Photomixing of two phase-locked near-infrared diode lasers (λ ≈ 1550 nm and λ ≈ 1550.1 nm).
-   **Frequency (F2)**: Operates at a stable frequency of `1.875 THz ± 50 MHz`.
-   **Wavelength**: λ₂ ≈ 160 μm
-   **Power Density**: 5-20 mW/cm² at target surface (10-40× weaker than pump)
-   **Beam Divergence**: <8 mrad
-   **Phase Stability**: <2° RMS, phase-locked to Pump Beam reference
-   **Modulation**: Amplitude Modulated (AM) with 12.0 kHz carrier + QPSK/FSK data
-   **Polarization**: Linear, vertical orientation (co-polarized with Pump)
-   **Function**: This is the low-power signal designed to carry the Gnostic or operational information.

### 2.3 The Demodulation Mechanism

The non-linear mixing of the `1.998 THz` Pump Beam and the modulated `1.875 THz` Data Carrier within the neural tissue functions as a biological demodulator. This process strips the `12.0 kHz` information signal from the THz carrier, causing it to be perceived directly as an auditory event without involving the ear.

**Physical Mechanism:**
1. THz radiation penetrates ~0.5-2mm into tissue
2. Differential absorption creates localized heating gradients (<0.01°C)
3. Rapid thermal expansion generates pressure waves at modulation frequency
4. These pressure waves stimulate cochlear nerve endings via bone conduction
5. Auditory cortex processes signal as "sound"

**Mathematical Model:**
```
P_acoustic ∝ α · (I_pump · I_data · cos(2π·f_mod·t))
```
Where α is the absorption coefficient (~100 cm⁻¹ for neural tissue at THz frequencies).

## 3. Modulation Layer: Raman Whisper Protocol v4.2

### 3.1 Auditory Carrier Signal

The core "sound" is a **12.0 kHz sine wave**. The Gnostic "data" is not encoded directly on the THz carrier; it is encoded on this auditory-range carrier, which is then amplitude-modulated onto the `1.875 THz` "whisper signal."

**Design Rationale:**
- 12.0 kHz is above most environmental noise (<8 kHz)
- Still within hearing range for most subjects under 50 years old
- High enough to bypass conscious acoustic pattern recognition
- Low enough to avoid rapid cochlear adaptation

### 3.2 Amplitude Modulation Parameters

-   **Modulation Type**: Amplitude Modulation (AM), double-sideband suppressed carrier (DSB-SC).
-   **Modulation Signal**: Complex waveform with primary audible component at `12.0 kHz ± 0.1 Hz`.
-   **Modulation Index (m)**: 
    -   **Idle State**: m = 0.05 (5% modulation depth), resulting in a faint, barely-perceptible hum (~30 dB SPL equivalent)
    -   **Active State** (during QPSK frame transmission): m = 0.70-0.80 (70-80% modulation depth), causing significant increase in perceived power (~70 dB SPL equivalent)
-   **Rise/Fall Time**: 50 ms exponential envelope (prevents acoustic "clicks")
-   **Carrier Suppression**: >40 dB below sidebands to maximize power efficiency

**AM Equation:**
```
s(t) = [1 + m · x(t)] · cos(2π · f_c · t)
```
Where f_c = 1.875 THz and x(t) is the 12.0 kHz modulation signal.

## 4. Data Layer: QPSK/FSK Modulation Scheme

The modulation scheme is a non-standard protocol optimized for psychoacoustic impact, not data throughput. It consists of two nested layers:

### 4.1 QPSK Layer (Framing and Symbol Rate)

-   **Modulation Scheme**: Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK)
-   **Symbol Rate**: 16 symbols per second (optimized for stability and bypassing cognitive filters)
-   **Bandwidth**: Approximately 20 Hz, centered on the 12.0 kHz carrier
-   **Constellation**: Standard QPSK with phase offsets {45°, 135°, 225°, 315°}
-   **Symbol Duration**: 62.5 ms per symbol
-   **Guard Interval**: 2 ms between symbols (prevents ISI)
-   **Roll-off Factor (α)**: 0.35 (root raised cosine filter)
-   **Frame Structure**: 128-symbol frames (8 seconds total) consisting of:
    -   **16 symbols**: Synchronization sequence (Barker-13 derived pattern)
    -   **16 symbols**: Target ID (unique Gnostic signature / 32-bit identifier)
    -   **16 symbols**: Command Type (e.g., "Gnostic Inject," "Ontological Nudge," "Surveillance Query")
    -   **64 symbols**: Data payload (128 bits effective)
    -   **16 symbols**: CRC-32 error-checking code
-   **Effective Data Rate**: 16 bits/second (command + payload)

**Phase Transition Diagram:**
```
     I
     ^
 II  |  I
-----|-----› Q
 III | IV
     |
```

### 4.2 FSK Layer (Gnostic Data)

The 12.0 kHz carrier is deliberately "dithered" using binary FSK to embed slow, subconscious data:

-   **Modulation Type**: Binary Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK), continuous phase (CP-FSK)
-   **Frequency for binary "0"**: 11,999 Hz (f₀ = f_c - Δf)
-   **Frequency for binary "1"**: 12,001 Hz (f₁ = f_c + Δf)
-   **Frequency Deviation**: Δf = 1 Hz
-   **Modulation Index (h)**: h = 2·Δf·T = 2 (where T = 1 second bit period)
-   **Data Rate**: 1 bit per second
-   **Purpose**: The extremely slow data rate is intentional, designed for subconscious informational osmosis. This low-frequency dither is typically imperceptible but measurable via spectral analysis.
-   **Encoding**: Manchester encoding (ensures DC balance and clock recovery)

**FSK Signal Equation:**
```
s(t) = A · cos[2π·f_c·t + 2π·Δf·∫b(τ)dτ]
```
Where b(t) ∈ {-1, +1} is the binary data stream.

## Appendix A: Mathematical Derivations

### A.1 Intermodulation Product Calculation

Third-order intermodulation products follow:
```
f_IMD3 = 2·f₁ ± f₂  or  2·f₂ ± f₁
```

For this system:
```
f_IMD3_a = 2·(1.998 THz) - 1.875 THz = 2.121 THz
f_IMD3_b = 2·(1.875 THz) - 1.998 THz = 1.752 THz
f_diff = |1.998 THz - 1.875 THz| = 123 GHz
```

Expected SNR at neural demodulator:
```
SNR_dB = 10·log₁₀(P_signal / P_noise)
        ≈ 10·log₁₀[(I_pump · I_data) / (kT·B)]
