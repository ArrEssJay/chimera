# GitOps Implementation Summary

This document describes the GitOps implementation for the Chimera repository that ensures feature branch merges into main require successful test deployment and site rendering verification.

## Overview

The GitOps workflow has been implemented using GitHub Actions with three key workflows:

1. **CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) - Continuous Integration
2. **Test Deployment Workflow** (`.github/workflows/test-deploy.yml`) - Pre-merge verification
3. **Deploy Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) - Production deployment

## Implementation Details

### 1. CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- All pushes to any branch
- All pull requests to `main`

**Jobs:**
- **test**: Runs `cargo test --workspace --all-features`
- **fmt**: Checks code formatting with `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- **clippy**: Runs linting with `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
- **build-web**: Builds the WASM web dashboard using trunk

**Key Features:**
- Uses GitHub Actions cache for faster builds
- Runs on every push and PR to catch issues early
- All jobs must pass for the CI check to succeed

### 2. Test Deployment Workflow (`test-deploy.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Pull requests to `main`

**Jobs:**
- **test-deployment**: 
  - Builds the web dashboard
  - Verifies build artifacts exist
  - Checks WASM files are generated
  - Validates HTML structure
  - Creates deployment summary
  - Posts status comment on PR with verification results

**Verification Steps:**
1. Confirms `dist/` directory exists
2. Confirms `index.html` exists
3. Confirms WASM files are present
4. Validates HTML contains expected content
5. Uploads artifacts for manual inspection if needed

**Key Features:**
- Provides early feedback on deployment viability
- Creates artifacts that can be downloaded and tested locally
- Posts verification status directly to the PR
- Retention period of 7 days for test artifacts

### 3. Deploy Workflow (`deploy.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Pushes to `main`
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Jobs:**
- **check-ci**: Verification gate that CI has passed
- **build**: Builds the web dashboard for production
- **deploy**: Deploys to GitHub Pages

**Enhancements:**
- Added `check-ci` job as a prerequisite for build
- Added caching for faster builds
- Maintains same deployment behavior as before

## Quality Gates

The implementation enforces the following quality gates before merging to main:

1. ✅ **All tests must pass** (`cargo test --workspace --all-features`)
2. ✅ **Code must be properly formatted** (`cargo fmt`)
3. ✅ **No linting errors** (`cargo clippy` with warnings as errors)
4. ✅ **Web dashboard must build successfully** (trunk build)
5. ✅ **Build artifacts must be valid** (HTML, WASM verification)

## Branch Protection Configuration

To fully enable GitOps, configure branch protection rules for `main`:

### Required Status Checks

Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging" and select:
- `test` (from CI workflow)
- `fmt` (from CI workflow)
- `clippy` (from CI workflow)
- `build-web` (from CI workflow)
- `test-deployment` (from test-deploy workflow)

See [docs/branch-protection.md](branch-protection.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Workflow Benefits

### For Feature Branches
- Immediate feedback on code quality
- Early detection of build issues
- Verification that changes will deploy successfully
- Confidence that the site will render properly

### For Main Branch
- Only tested, verified code gets merged
- Automated deployment after merge
- Protection against breaking changes
- Maintains high code quality standards

## Testing the Implementation

### Local Testing Before Push

Run these commands locally before pushing:

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt --all

# Run lints
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Run tests
cargo test --workspace --all-features

# Build web dashboard
cd chimera-web
trunk build --release
```

### Verifying CI on GitHub

1. Create a feature branch
2. Make changes and push
3. CI workflow will run automatically
4. Check the Actions tab for results
5. Create a PR to main
6. Test deployment workflow will run
7. Review the verification comment on the PR

## Code Changes Made

The following code changes were made to ensure CI compliance:

### Clippy Fixes
- Fixed manual `div_ceil` implementations using `.div_ceil()` method
- Removed unnecessary type casts
- Fixed needless range loops using iterators with enumerate
- Fixed needless borrows in function calls
- Fixed field assignments outside of initializers
- Fixed manual clamp implementation using `.clamp()` method

All fixes maintain the same behavior while following Rust best practices.

## Continuous Improvement

This implementation can be enhanced further:

### Potential Future Additions
- Automated performance benchmarks in CI
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Dependency update automation (Dependabot)
- Code coverage reporting
- Automated changelog generation
- Preview deployments for PRs (using GitHub Pages environments)

## Troubleshooting

### CI Failures

If CI fails:
1. Check the GitHub Actions log for the specific failure
2. Run the failing command locally to reproduce
3. Fix the issue and push again

### Test Deployment Failures

If test deployment fails:
1. Verify trunk is installed: `cargo install trunk --locked`
2. Check that wasm32 target is installed: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
3. Try building locally: `cd chimera-web && trunk build --release`

### Deployment Failures

If production deployment fails after merge:
1. Check that all CI checks passed
2. Review the deploy workflow logs
3. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings

## Documentation

Additional documentation:
- [Branch Protection Setup Guide](branch-protection.md) - Detailed instructions for configuring branch protection
- [README.md](../README.md) - Updated with GitOps workflow information

## Summary

The GitOps implementation successfully ensures that:
1. ✅ All code changes are tested before merging
2. ✅ Test deployments verify the site builds and renders correctly
3. ✅ Only verified code reaches production
4. ✅ The workflow is automated and requires no manual intervention
5. ✅ Quality gates prevent broken code from being merged

This implementation fulfills the issue requirements: "Ensure merge from feature branches into main requires a successful test deployment and that the site renders."
